Two topics were presented by Henrik Kärkkänen about IT Journalism and by Samuli Järvinen about Cognitive warfare.

1. Henrik Kärkkänen is a journalist from Ilta Sanomat presented IT and Technology related news examples and how they were presented to audience. Henrik is an IT journalist that is telling the news in the way that they can reach as many readers as possible, and cover not only IT people. Few examples he showed were about scams and that people shouldn't be embarrased to tell about them as it can help to somebody else to avoid the similar situation. The presenter stressed importance of repeating such stories in media so that more people can read them and that can save their money. He also gave examples where media exaggerated risk of some events and spread unnecessary panic

2. Samuli Järvinen

Cognitive warfare is the attack on truth and thought. Samuli told about the ways of cognitive manipulation so that audience be aware.

An interesting example of TikTok (Chinese Company) was given. Samuli said that the algorithms in China and Western countries work differently. This topic seems discussed a lot in Internet. China's TikTok is more child-friendly, promotes healthy behavior and suggests educational videos. It also has time limit, forces people to take breaks. This version of the program is not what Western world receives and doesn't limit content for children there. It also promotes enless stream of all possible videos.
I understand that this example was a hint that there is a constant manipulation thorough mass media. China has possibility and seems uses it for manipulation of Western countries and controlling behavior of own citizens.

Another example about a former US Army major and his wife working in a ospital who were ready to leak sensitive data of US miltary patients to Russia. The wife  seems believed in Russia's actions in Ukraine and even showed her patriotism towards Russia. The guys are suggested as possible targets of manipulation.. or not..


Samuli suggests to think as a predator if someone doesn't want to become a prey. 'Prey - See yourself as the predetor sees you' (copied from the Samuli's presentation)

A predator has objectives
        emotional trust 
        or coercion

Gathering data or profiling a target is a preparation part for manipulation. The predetor must know as much as possible about the target. Analysis happens through learning activities, hobbies, 'looking for a private self'. Examples from media were given: what can we get from shared pictures, videos. What connection to other people, how target's role or power is changing depending on a situation. Network activities, gaming, media.
Gaming with people a powerful tool against a target: building a connection with other players, can be used as a tool against the target

There are universal values that all people follow in some way and these values are also strong tools for manipulation. Example is Care, and possibility to influence a loving owner of a pet using this emotional attachment.

We spread a lot of info that we think is not important, but it can be one day when this can be good material for a profile against us.
